musicnn-training
In this repository you will find the Tensorflow code for training deep convolutional neural networks for audio-tagging.

We employed this code for training musicnn, a set of pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks for music audio tagging.

Installation:
git clone https://github.com/jordipons/musicnn-training.git

Create a python3 virtual environment python3 -m venv env, activate it source ./env/bin/activate, and install the dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt

Install tensorflow for CPU pip install tensorflow==1.14.0 or for CUDA-enabled GPU pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0. Note this code was developed following Tensorflow 1 API, not Tensorflow 2.

Usage
Download a music audio tagging dataset:
For example, download the MagnaTagATune dataset.

Preprocess the dataset:
To preprocess the data, first set some config_file.py variables:

DATA_FOLDER, where you want to store all your intermediate files (see folders structure below).
config_preprocess['audio_folder'], where your dataset is located.
Preprocess the data acessing to src/ and running python preprocess_librosa.py mtt_spec. The mtt_spec option is defined in config_file.py

After running preprocess_librosa.py, the computed spectrograms are in ../DATA_FOLDER/audio_representation/mtt__time-freq/

Warning!
Rename ../DATA_FOLDER/audio_representation/mtt__time-freq/index_0.tsv to index.tsv. This is because this script is parallelizable. In case you parallelized the pre-processing accross several machines, copy the files in the same direcotry and run cat index* > index.tsv

Train and evaluate a model:
Define the training parameters by setting the config_train dictionary in config_file.py, and run CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py spec. The spec option is defined in config_file.py

Once training is done, the trained model is stored in, e.g.: ../DATA_FOLDER/experiments/1563524626spec/

To evaluate the model, run CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python evaluate.py 1563524626spec

Scripts
Configuration and preprocessing scripts:

config_file.py: file with all configurable parameters.
preprocess_librosa.py: pre-computes and stores the spectrograms.
Scripts for running deep learning experiments:

train.py: run it to train your model. First set config_train in config_file.py
evaluate.py: run it to evaluate the previously trained model.
models.py, models_baselines.py, models_frontend.py, models_midend.py, models_backend.py: scripts where the architectures are defined.
Auxiliar scripts:

shared.py: script containing util functions (e.g., for plotting or loading files).
train_exec.py: script to successively run several pre-configured experiments.
Folders structure
/src: folder containing previous scripts.
/aux: folder containing additional auxiliar scripts. These scripts are used to generate the index files for each dataset. The index files are already computed in /data/index/
/data: where all intermediate files (spectrograms, results, etc.) will be stored.
/data/index/: indexed files containing the correspondences between audio files and their ground truth. Index files for the MagnaTagATune dataset (mtt) and the Million Song Dataset (msd) are already provided.
When running previous scripts, the following folders will be created:

./data/audio_representation/: where spectrogram patches are stored.
./data/experiments/: where the results of the experiments are stored.
